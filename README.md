## Transparent-Government-Project
Building this website was a great Javascript challenge. I've implemented a custom version of the MVC model. This project focuses on JS algorithms, calculations, statistics and built in array methods while working with raw data fetched from a US Government API. The styling is minimalistic due to the content's nature and was done with Bootstrap.

Design: Desktop

Features: 
  - Up to date information on the current American Congress (Senate and HOR)
  - Filters according to state and party affiliation
  - Calculations on attendance (most and least engaged)
  - Calculations on party loyalty (most and least loyal Reps and Senators)
  - Statistics in table format
