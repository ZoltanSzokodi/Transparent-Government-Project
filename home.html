            <p class="card-text">Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free
              society, transparency is government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart of
              how citizens hold their public officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that government should be
              transparent.
              <br><br>
              Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the public business and spend
              taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency allows good and just
              governance. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their
              Government is doing.
              <br><br>
              We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the Government's
              effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in society, and
              public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use our site to
              become actively engaged in American government.
              <br><br>
              TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and use. We solicit public
              feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.</p>

                      In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible to public
                      opinion dates back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an attack
                      on absolutist doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project. The passage of
                      formal legislative instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with Sweden, for
                      example,
                      (which then included Finland as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press legislation as
                      part of its constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This approach, and that of the
                      philosophes more broadly, is strongly related to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century
                      public sphere.
                      <br><br>
                      Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France (1789), freedom
                      of
                      the press enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and freedom of the
                      press in constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen
                      to
                      row back on these measures were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians and
                      writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent among the latter.
                      <br><br>
                      Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic practice and is
                      often
                      linked to the passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to have
                      adopted the first freedom of information legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions
                      to
                      the eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of openness after gaining
                      independence
                      in 1917, passing its Act on Publicity of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new legislation
                      in 1999).
                      <br><br>
                      The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to
                      Information
                      Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.
